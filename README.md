# dotfiles

A collection of the random personal Linux configuration files I've accumulated
over the years.

This repo is mainly for my personal use across the various machines I work with
but it's possible others will find one or two things in here that are useful.
I'm not putting much time into maintaining or evolving most of these, but if you
see anything thats obviously wrong or missing let me know.

Checkout with `git clone https://github.com/jodysankey/dotfiles.git`

I use the `stitch_dotfiles` script in my
[scripts repo](https://github.com/jodysankey/dotfiles.git) to automatically
clone the repo and link files in my home directory to the corresponding file
in the clone directory.
